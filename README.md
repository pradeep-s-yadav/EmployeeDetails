# EmployeeDetails


Hi! 

My name is Pradeep and this Project is a prototype of a project for storing employee details by taking input from the frontend
and saving it in the SQL Database using backend using Restful APIs.

Tech stacks used are:

ReactJS + JavaScript + Bootstrap (Frontend),
SpringBoot + Java  (Backend),
MySQL (Database)

Please note that there are two different braches - frontend and backend for frontend and backend files respectively.
