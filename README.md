# EmployeeDetails


Hi! 

My name is Pradeep and this Project is a prototype of a project for storing employee details by taking input from the frontend
and saving it in the SQL Database using backend using Restful APIs.

Tech stacks used are:

ReactJS + JavaScript + Bootstrap (Frontend),
SpringBoot + Java  (Backend),
MySQL (Database)

Please note that there are 3 different braches - 2 frontend and 1 backend files.

Frontend-ReactApp branch has React Application where as Frontend-User branch has to do with creating, updating and deleting the employee using Hooks.
